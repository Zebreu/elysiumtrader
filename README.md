# Elysium Trader
Mod for Conquest of Elysium 5 that allows players to trade resources via a trader unit.

Traders are now available as a commander unit that's always recruitable. The unit will vanish upon arrival at the home citadel of a player, and an event will trigger to provide the corresponding value.
